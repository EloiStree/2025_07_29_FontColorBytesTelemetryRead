# Perspective Warping & Homography 


I will need to use  homography to reset the picture write if trick shot code dont succeed.
I just need to read 4*300 pixels from the render texture. I can do that on jbo system.
But I am affraid of need to use it one day for the map of wow for example.
Or simple to have a 2D display from the real life in the Quest3
